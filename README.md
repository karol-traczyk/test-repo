## 🎬 Fun Fact About "Goodfellas"

The iconic "Funny how?" scene where Joe Pesci's character Tommy DeVito intimidates Henry Hill was completely improvised! Joe Pesci based it on a real-life encounter from his youth when he was working as a waiter and told a mobster he was funny. The scene wasn't in the script, and Ray Liotta's nervous reaction was genuine because he had no idea where Pesci was going with it. Director Martin Scorsese loved it so much that he kept it in the film, and it became one of the most memorable moments in cinema history.
