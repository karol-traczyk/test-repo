## Poem
Cursor hums a quiet tune in code's sea,
Mapping tangled thoughts to what they could be,
Guiding keys like lantern light at night,
Turning TODO shadows into lines of bright.

When logic knots and symbols misalign,
Cursor jokes, "Let's refactor this design,"
We pair-program with coffee, calm and keen,
Reviewing bugs like detectives on the scene.

Sprint winds down, commits begin to glow,
Cursor logs our progress row by row,
In this lab of pixels, hopes unfurl,
Shipping dreams in every compiled swirl.
