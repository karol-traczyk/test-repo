# Indie Game Starter Guide

Welcome! This repository is meant to be a gentle on-ramp for solo developers or tiny teams who want to dive into indie game development. Use it as a checklist of first steps, a reminder to keep scope manageable, and a hub for helpful resources.

## What Is Indie Game Development?

Indie game development typically means building games with:

- **Small scope:** Focus on a tight, well-defined experience rather than an open-world epic.
- **Limited resources:** You might be the programmer, artist, writer, and marketer all at once.
- **High creativity:** Constraints push you to find unique mechanics, art styles, or stories.

Success here comes from picking achievable goals, iterating quickly, and learning as you go.

## Choose Your Engine

Pick an engine that matches your skills, target platforms, and preferred workflow:

- **Unity** – Massive ecosystem, C#, great for 2D/3D, lots of tutorials. Cons: licensing changes and complex UI can overwhelm newcomers.
- **Godot** – Open source, lightweight, friendly scripting (GDScript/C#/C++), excellent for 2D. Cons: smaller community, fewer advanced 3D tools.
- **Unreal Engine** – Top-tier visuals, Blueprints for visual scripting, strong 3D tooling. Cons: heavier hardware requirements and steeper learning curve.
- **GameMaker** – Rapid 2D prototyping with drag-and-drop plus GML scripting. Cons: limited 3D support and smaller plugin marketplace.

**How to choose:** list your target platforms, team skills, and desired art style. Install one engine, follow its “Hello World” tutorial, and only switch if it clearly blocks your progress.

## Core Tools & Workflow

- **Version control:** Initialize Git and push to GitHub early. Commit small changes often so you can safely experiment.
- **Project management:** Track tasks in a lightweight board (GitHub Projects, Trello, Notion). Keep backlog, “doing,” and “done” columns.
- **Art tools:** Start with free basics—Krita or Aseprite for pixel art, Blender for simple 3D, Photopea/Canva for UI mockups.
- **Audio tools:** Use Bfxr/ChipTone for retro effects, Audacity for editing, and explore free soundtrack libraries (OpenGameArt, Pixabay).
- **Build/test automation:** Set up simple scripts or CI to build the project and run any automated checks the engine supports.

## Learning Resources

- **Official docs:** Unity Learn, Godot Docs, Unreal Online Learning, GameMaker Manual—follow their beginner tracks end-to-end.
- **Video courses:** Udemy’s “Complete 2D/3D” series, Brackeys (Unity), HeartBeast (Godot), Unreal Sensei (Unreal).
- **Communities:** Join engine-specific Discords, r/gamedev, and local game-dev meetups or jams for feedback.
- **Practice:** Clone sample projects/templates provided by the engine and tinker—break things on purpose to see how they work.

## Start Your First Tiny Project

1. **Pick a micro concept:** Pong, endless runner, single-screen platformer—something you can finish in 1–2 weeks.
2. **Create a fresh repo:** Copy any starter template from this repo or your engine’s sample project to get the scaffolding in place.
3. **Define the minimum playable version:** Core mechanic, simple art, placeholder audio, basic UI.
4. **Build in layers:** Prototype gameplay, polish controls, add juice (particles, sounds), then refine menus and UX.
5. **Playtest constantly:** Run the game after every change; note bugs and ideas but only fix what keeps you from finishing.

## Stay Motivated & Finish

- **Keep scope small:** Ship a toy first. Sequels can be bigger.
- **Iterate in public:** Share GIFs or devlogs weekly to stay accountable and get feedback.
- **Playtest early:** Watching others struggle reveals priorities faster than guessing.
- **Schedule breaks:** Short, focused sessions beat all-night crunches.
- **Celebrate milestones:** Mark off completed tasks, tag releases, and archive builds so you can see progress.

You now have a roadmap—clone this repo, pick an engine, and build something tiny today. Small finished games teach more than giant unfinished ones. Have fun!
