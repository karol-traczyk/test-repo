## 🎄 Christmas Carol

### "Gentle Snow, Gentle Light"

**Verse 1:**  
The snowflakes fall on silent streets,  
Where glowing lanterns softly shine,  
A peaceful hush the evening greets,  
As hearts draw close in warmth divine.

**Chorus:**  
Gentle snow, gentle light,  
Fill our hearts this winter night,  
Love and laughter, joy so bright,  
Christmas blessings pure and white.

**Verse 2:**  
The children sing by fireside glow,  
With stories told of years gone by,  
While ribbons dance on gifts below,  
And stars watch from the frosty sky.

**Chorus:**  
Gentle snow, gentle light,  
Fill our hearts this winter night,  
Love and laughter, joy so bright,  
Christmas blessings pure and white.

**Verse 3:**  
Together now with family near,  
We share the gifts of hope and grace,  
The spirit of this time so dear,  
Reflects in every smiling face.

**Chorus:**  
Gentle snow, gentle light,  
Fill our hearts this winter night,  
Love and laughter, joy so bright,  
Christmas blessings pure and white.

**Final Verse:**  
So let us sing through winter's chill,  
Of peace on earth and kindness true,  
With grateful hearts that overflow still,  
This Christmas joy we share with you.

**Chorus:**  
Gentle snow, gentle light,  
Fill our hearts this winter night,  
Love and laughter, joy so bright,  
Christmas blessings pure and white.
