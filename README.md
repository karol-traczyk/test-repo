## Inspiration
Bright commits hum softly in the repo night.
Branches bloom with ideas chasing light.
Merge winds carry whispers kind and clear.
Bugs become puzzles, never ghosts to fear.
Scripts share stories in a humble tone.
Tests cheer loudly when their seeds are sown.
Docs grow pathways paved with open hands.
CI beats steady like friendly marching bands.
Hackers bring colors in a hopeful swirl.
PRs twirl gently, invitation's unfurl.
Stars map futures on the dashed command line.
Together we craft constellations of design.
