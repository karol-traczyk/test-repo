## Trivia

Did you know that the first computer bug was an actual bug? 🐛

In 1947, Grace Hopper and her team were working on the Harvard Mark II computer when it malfunctioned. Upon investigation, they discovered a moth trapped in one of the computer's relays! They carefully removed it and taped it into their logbook with the note "First actual case of bug being found." This incident popularized the terms "bug" and "debugging" in computer science.

The original logbook page with the taped moth is now preserved at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.
