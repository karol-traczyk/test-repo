## Prompt Tips

Craft better AI prompts using these practical guidelines:

- **Be specific about goals and constraints**: Clearly state what you want to achieve and what to avoid. Define success criteria upfront.
- **Provide context**: Share background information, domain details, prior attempts, and relevant examples to ground the AI's understanding.
- **Define output format**: Specify the desired structure (bullets, JSON schema, tables, code blocks) with a short template or example.
- **Supply examples and counterexamples**: Use few-shot guidance when helpful—show what good and bad outputs look like.
- **State evaluation criteria**: List what a good answer must include, edge cases to consider, and how to measure success.
- **Prefer iterative refinement**: Ask for critique, request a second pass, or build on previous responses rather than expecting perfection immediately.
- **Include limits and constraints**: Mention time, token, or tool limitations, and cite required sources or references.
- **Clarify audience and tone**: Specify who will read the output (beginners, experts) and the appropriate style (formal, casual, technical).
- **Ask for uncertainties and assumptions**: Request that the AI list assumptions made and flag areas of uncertainty.

### Prompt Template

Use this template to structure your prompts:

```
**Context**: [Background, domain, relevant details]

**Task**: [What you need done, specific goals]

**Constraints**: [What to avoid, limitations, requirements]

**Format**: [Desired output structure, e.g., bullet list, JSON, table]

**Success Criteria**: [What makes the output good, edge cases to handle]

**Audience/Tone**: [Who's reading this, style preferences]
```
