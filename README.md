## Christmas Poem
Snow drifts softly past our glowing screens tonight,
Branches twinkle while our build lights shine so bright.
Lines of code hum cozy carols in the queue,
Pull requests glow red and green with something new.
We wrap up bugs like presents tied with care,
Sharing cheer in every commit we share.
Coffee steams like chimneys in the frosty air,
Teamwork keeps the winter winds from chilling there.
May every log feel merry, every test feel light,
Happy Christmas, fellow coders, and to all a joyful night.
