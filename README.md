## Tips

Here are some practical tips for working with this repository:

### Best Practices

- **Commit Often, Commit Early**: Make small, focused commits with clear messages. This makes it easier to track changes and revert if needed.

- **Keep Your Branch Updated**: Regularly pull changes from the main branch to avoid merge conflicts and stay in sync with the team.

- **Write Meaningful Commit Messages**: Use descriptive commit messages that explain *why* a change was made, not just *what* was changed.

- **Review Before You Push**: Always review your changes before pushing. Use `git diff` to check what you're committing.

- **Use Branches for Features**: Create a separate branch for each new feature or bug fix. This keeps the main branch stable and clean.

### Workflow Tips

- **Test Locally First**: Run tests and verify your changes work locally before pushing to remote.

- **Document As You Go**: Update documentation when you make changes. Future you (and your teammates) will thank you.

- **Clean Up Old Branches**: Delete merged branches to keep your repository organized and easy to navigate.

- **Use .gitignore Effectively**: Keep your repository clean by ignoring build artifacts, dependencies, and environment-specific files.
