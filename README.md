## Polish National Holiday - August 15th

August 15th is a significant national holiday in Poland, commemorating two important celebrations:

### Assumption of Mary (Wniebowzięcie Najświętszej Maryi Panny)
This is a major Catholic feast day celebrating the belief that the Virgin Mary was assumed into heaven, both body and soul, at the end of her earthly life. As Poland is a predominantly Catholic country, this religious holiday holds deep cultural and spiritual significance for the Polish people.

### Polish Armed Forces Day (Święto Wojska Polskiego)
August 15th also serves as Polish Armed Forces Day, honoring the Polish military and commemorating the victory in the Battle of Warsaw (1920) during the Polish-Soviet War. This battle was crucial in defending Polish independence and is considered one of the most important military victories in Polish history.

**Note:** August 15th is an official public holiday in Poland, meaning it is a national day off for most workers and institutions.
