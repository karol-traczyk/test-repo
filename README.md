## Clean Code Tips

- Prefer small, single-purpose functions or modules so intent stays obvious.
- Use meaningful, consistent naming—pick verbs for actions and nouns for data.
- Separate concerns by keeping UI, business rules, and data access isolated.
- Keep things DRY: extract shared logic instead of copying snippets around.
- Handle errors explicitly and consistently; surface helpful context for debugging.
- Keep tests current alongside examples to lock in behavior and prevent regressions.
