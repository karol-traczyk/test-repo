## Code Tips

Here are some practical coding tips to help improve your development workflow:

### Code Readability
- **Write self-documenting code**: Use descriptive variable and function names that clearly convey their purpose. Avoid cryptic abbreviations and single-letter variables (except for common conventions like loop counters).
- **Keep functions focused and small**: Each function should do one thing well. If a function is doing multiple tasks, consider breaking it into smaller, reusable functions.
- **Add meaningful comments**: Comment on *why* something is done, not *what* is being done. The code itself should make the "what" clear.

### Version Control Best Practices
- **Write clear commit messages**: Use descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose of the change. Follow the convention: start with a verb in present tense (e.g., "Add feature X", "Fix bug in Y").
- **Commit frequently with small, logical changes**: Make small, focused commits rather than large, monolithic ones. This makes it easier to track changes, review code, and revert if needed.
- **Keep your branches up to date**: Regularly merge or rebase from the main branch to avoid merge conflicts and ensure you're working with the latest code.

### Testing & Quality
- **Test early and often**: Write tests as you develop, not as an afterthought. This helps catch bugs early and ensures your code works as expected.
- **Aim for meaningful test coverage**: Focus on testing critical paths and edge cases rather than just aiming for high coverage percentages.
- **Use linters and formatters**: Automate code style checking with tools like ESLint, Prettier, or Black to maintain consistency across your codebase.

### Performance & Optimization
- **Profile before optimizing**: Don't optimize prematurely. Use profiling tools to identify actual bottlenecks before spending time on optimization.
- **Consider time and space complexity**: Be mindful of algorithm efficiency, especially when working with large datasets or performance-critical code.
