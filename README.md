## Clean Code Tips
- Prefer descriptive, intention-revealing names so readers know what a unit owns or does.
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility and break up long logic into smaller helpers.
- Handle errors explicitly with actionable messages instead of silently failing or returning ambiguous values.
- Eliminate duplication by extracting shared behavior; repeated code hides bugs and inflates maintenance cost.
- Write tests for the paths that matter most so refactors can happen with confidence.
- Format consistently (lint/formatters) to highlight meaningful diffs rather than stylistic noise.
