Refresh

## Haiku

Soft keyboards whisper
Commits drift like autumn leaves
Calm builds our new dawn

Debug lanterns glow
Errors surface, tell their tales
Patience mends the thread

Test suites bloom at dusk
Pipelines breathe a steady song
Hope deploys with grace

Flowing loops align
Logic gardens patiently
Kind builds never rush
