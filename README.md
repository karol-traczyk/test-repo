## Clean Code Tips
Keep changes small and intentional so the code stays easy to reason about. Clean code makes reviews faster and future edits safer.

- Use meaningful names that reveal intent.
- Keep functions focused on one responsibility.
- Avoid duplication; extract shared logic early.
- Write comments only when they clarify non-obvious decisions.
- Stick to consistent formatting and linting rules.
