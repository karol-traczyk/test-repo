## "See" – A Reflective Poem

First light leans through windows clouded with routine dust,  
Tracing questions on the tables no one thought to ask.  
I gather every hush the evening left in trust,  
To stitch them into courage for the day’s unsteady task.

The city hums in minor keys yet dares a hopeful chord,  
Even cracked pavements cradle roots that rise without applause.  
I learn to read the everyday as letters from the Lord,  
A quiet script of second chances inked between the flaws.

So let the dusk arrive with lanterns trimmed in patient gold,  
We’ll trade our borrowed sorrows for a promise yet unseen.  
Within the gentle seeing of a heart that won’t grow cold,  
Tomorrow waits, a brighter verb, becoming what we mean.
