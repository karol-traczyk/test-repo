## Lanterns Over Quiet Code

Lanterns drift above the quiet code,
Each glow a question waiting for reply.
Midnight windows hum with gentle nodes,
While hearts collect the spark of firefly.

I trade the rush of cities for the key
That turns a line into a meteor's arc,
And let the looping breeze remind of seas
Where promise shimmers softly in the dark.

May every dream inherit patient light,
A lighthouse spun from kindness and from lore.
I walk this dusk believing dawn will write
New constellations we have yet to store.
