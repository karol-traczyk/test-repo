# Dawn Ledger

Mist unwinds gently over the patient river bend  
Sunrise sketches copper runes on drifting steam  
A heron holds its pose like a paused idea  
Pebbles keep counsel beneath the murmuring glass  
I breathe in stories steeped overnight in dew  
Light tips the reeds with pocket-sized revelations  
Small waves trade secrets in a hush of silver  
A distant train stitches morning to remembered nights  
Hope rows quietly beside the waking current  
My doubts loosen, untying knots from the shoreline  
Every ripple signs my name in cursive wind  
Clouds rehearse soft endings for the moon's retreat  
I promise to listen longer than the rush of clocks  
And leave the banks tidier than my restless mind
