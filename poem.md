# Dawn Ledger

Mist unwinds gently over the patient river bend  
Sunrise sketches copper runes on drifting steam  
A heron holds its pose like a paused idea  
Pebbles keep counsel beneath the murmuring glass  
I breathe in stories steeped overnight in dew  
Light tips the reeds with pocket-sized revelations  
Small waves trade secrets in a hush of silver  
A distant train stitches morning to remembered nights  
Hope rows quietly beside the waking current  
My doubts loosen, untying knots from the shoreline  
Every ripple signs my name in cursive wind  
Clouds rehearse soft endings for the moon's retreat  
I promise to listen longer than the rush of clocks  
And leave the banks tidier than my restless mind

## Whispered Commit

Morning hum drifts through the cobalt air,
Servers stretch awake in lines of light.
I stitch small dreams with deliberate care,
Letting the code-breeze carry them bright.

Coffee rings mark maps of the unseen,
Every stain a planet we might chart.
Keys fall soft like rain on fields of green,
Growing release notes out of the heart.

Day leans close to hear the testing wind,
Pipelines bloom, a meadow built of checks.
When the dusk unplugs the sun we pinned,
Hope stays cached in branches cross our decks.
