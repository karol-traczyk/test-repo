## Testing Winds

Morning boots up on a humming screen,  
Sunlight debugs every brittle doubt;  
Coffee commits warmth into the routine,  
While rubber ducks talk the errors out.

Thoughts branch wide like a daring `git push`,  
Dreams lint clean in the patient night;  
Green checks bloom with a gentle whoosh,  
Shipping hope in a merge of light.
